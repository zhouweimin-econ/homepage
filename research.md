    abstract: Understanding the impacts of new technology and innovations on the banking sector is important and of growing interest. However, there is limited research on the detailed channels of the impacts, and consequently, the evaluations for the aggregate welfare implications. We contribute both empirically and quantitatively. We use bank panel dataset and construct a new measure of overall banking innovations to document that banking innovations can reduce marginal net costs, which improve efficiency and may unintended increase bank risk-taking. We show the finding is quite robust under a battery of checks. In a new structural, quantitative model, banks with heterogeneous capital choose investment in innovation and also risky lending, face regulations on the capital requirement and have limited liability. When aggregate new technology improves, it can reduce financial intermediation costs and social deadweight loss; however, it will also change the bank's risk consideration and increases moral hazard when the cost is largely reduced. We also find several other new implications for R\&D investment credit policy and Capital Requirement policy.

    description: <strong>Firm Intangible Capital and Cash Flow-based Borrowing Constraints</strong> 
    authors: with Renbin Zhang
    numbering: 2
    abstract: This paper studies the nature of borrowing constraints that firms face in an increasingly intangible economy. Using US non-financial firm-level data, we document that for intangible-intensive firms, investment is less sensitive to monetary shocks. We further provide evidence that intangible-intensive firms are more likely to borrow under cash flow-based contracts. Motivated by these findings, we build a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model of intangible capital and endogenous loan contracts. Heterogeneous firms with ex ante identical capital structure choose loan contracts based on their idiosyncratic risks in intangible productivity efficiency. At the aggregate level, firm borrowings are subject to both asset-based part and cash flow-based part, which tightly links with its intangible capital ratio. Using this framework, we will be able to discuss not only the relevance of cash flow-based borrowing associated with the rising intangible capital, but also rationalize the empirical findings.
