    abstract: Understanding the impacts of new technology and innovations on the banking sector is important and of growing interest. However, there is limited research on the detailed channels of the impacts, and consequently, the evaluations for the aggregate welfare implications. We contribute both empirically and quantitatively. We use bank panel dataset and construct a new measure of overall banking innovations to document that banking innovations can reduce marginal net costs, which improve efficiency and may unintended increase bank risk-taking. We show the finding is quite robust under a battery of checks. In a new structural, quantitative model, banks with heterogeneous capital choose investment in innovation and also risky lending, face regulations on the capital requirement and have limited liability. When aggregate new technology improves, it can reduce financial intermediation costs and social deadweight loss; however, it will also change the bank's risk consideration and increases moral hazard when the cost is largely reduced. We also find several other new implications for R\&D investment credit policy and Capital Requirement policy.

    description: <strong>Firm Intangible Capital, Borrower Type Heterogeneity, and Monetary Policy</strong> [Coming soon]

    abstract: This paper studies the role of loan contracts and intangible capital on the transmission of monetary policy to firm-level investment. Using US non-financial firm-level data, we find that, for firms subject to loan covenants, the investment of firms with relatively more intangible assets responds more to monetary shocks. By classifying firms contract types, we further document that this pattern is driven by cash flow-based borrowers. We rationalize the empirical results using a tractable general equilibrium New Keynesian model. The choice of loan contracts depends on firms' investment decision, firms optimally allocate tangible and intangible investment based on idiosyncratic investment efficiency. Tangible assets can be pledged as collateral and the unpledgeable intangible assets improve profitability. For cash flow-based borrowers, an interest rate hike decrease the number of firms who invest more in intangibles, via the extensive margin, which amplifies the investment channel, therefore they respond more to the monetary policy conditional on higher intangible assets. We also conduct some policy analysis such as macro-prudential policy regulating firms' leverage under alternative contracts.

    abstract: 无形资本对企业创新和经济增长具有重要作用。准确地度量各类无形资本、更好地解释无形资本对企业行为和宏观经济发展的影响，也成为经济学研究的前沿问题之一。本文系统梳理国外宏观金融领域涉及无形资本的相关文献和最新研究进展，重点介绍各类无形资本的相关定义及其度量方式，从微观企业和宏观经济两个视角对已有文献进行归纳总结和深入分析。在微观影响方面，现有研究主要从无形资本对企业投融资、生产率水平及市场资产定价等角度进行分析。在宏观视角方面，现有文献主要聚焦于无形资本对经济增长核算、短期经济波动、市场结构变化等方面的影响。本文最后对未来研究方向进行评述与展望，同时也为落实我国企业科技创新的主体地位提供了政策启示。

    description: <strong>房地产税收调控政策与限购政策对房价的影响研究</strong>

    abstract: 房地产交易环节税收调节政策对房价的影响取决于限购政策的松紧程度。基于居民异质性预期的一般均衡模型，我们发现交易环节税收的不平等在买卖双方间产生了税收楔子，居民基于自身对未来房屋居住价值的异质性预期，选择成为买方、卖方或观望者。增加交易环节税收同时影响交易市场的买卖双方，产生了一般均衡效应，这使得买方的购房需求函数和卖方的住房供给函数同时左移，限购政策的松紧则影响了购房需求函数左移的程度。因此，当限购政策趋紧时，调高交易环节税收反而刺激房价上涨；当限购政策较松时，交易环节税收优惠则能发挥刺激房价的作用。

    abstract: We show that the classical optimal flexible nominal price (inflation) fails to complete the market.  The nominal price that is desired to implement the complete market social planner allocations turns out to negative for some states of the economy. Incomplete market imposes the one-period forward-looking implementability constraint for the Ramsey social planner, the primal approach indicates that the Friedman Rule does not hold anymore. We formulate the recursive contract approach by imposing a lower bound of money asset and find that government optimally accumulate the public debt and the tax rate featuring incomplete market emerge.

    description: <strong>Technological Innovation, Bank Deposits, and Systemic Risk</strong>
    numbering: 3
    abstract: This paper investigates the role of bank's use of new technologies under China's interest-rate based monetary transmission. Using a bank-panel dataset merged bank patent applications, I document that during monetary expansion, banks with higher technological innovations attract more deposits with fewer interest expenses since their deposits contain more demand deposits with higher liquidity. Moreover, banks with higher innovations accumulate larger systemic risks, especially during economic downturns.
